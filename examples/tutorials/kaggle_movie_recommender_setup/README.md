# Intro to Bootstrapping a Kaggle Notebook

For this example, we will be using [Getting Started with a Movie Recommendation System](https://www.kaggle.com/code/ibtesama/getting-started-with-a-movie-recommendation-system).

Please start with [Setup Instructions](Setup_Instructions.ipynb).

Note that this notebook has already been provisioned to have all the required files to run the notebook. The files are already present in the correct directories. If you want to practice running it yourself, start by `rm -r ./reqs`.

If you have any questions on setup, please let us know. If you find any bugs, please submit a PR =] .
